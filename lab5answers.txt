9. lfdx is completed at cycle 49.  

    Last is 613 or  707. vilken? Arvid tycker matten säger 613 men bägge tycker att mönstret säger 707. och väldigt mycket annat pekar på 707.


 clockcycle 341 -> (341-49)/100 = cirka 3 (2.92)


 10.

instruction 9 , cycle 43

instruction 405, cycle 637

(637- 43 ) / 100 = 5,94 

5,94 cycles per iteration 


the dependency of getting the last iteration done before the new can start. (cannot issue sources not ready yet)

12.

avoid div! 

cannot issue source not ready yet

cannot issue unit not free

renaming registers is to allow out of order execution and parallel execution. 
when issuing a instruction the cpu picks a register from a pool of physical registers, avoiding the use of the same architectural register name when working in parallel.
the instructions refer to these physical registers instead of the architectural ones, allowing multiple instructions that need the same architectural register to work without conflict.


speculative need rename register. during speculative execution a value gets written to a register, then it can be renamed if its not needed.

none speculative does not need it as they just work, business as usual.
